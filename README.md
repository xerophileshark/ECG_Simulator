# ECG_Simulator

In this project, ECG signal simulation is done in order to test an actual heartbeat monitoring device. The simulations are based on three methods:
1. Real ECG data -> ecgsimulator1.ino
2. Fourier series method -> ecgsimulator2.ino
3. An accurate programmable method based on M. Nasor's paper -> ecgsimulator3.ino
